# SKP INTRA

Short group project which was about setting up an Intranet / forum site up for the school.
Whereas users would be able to post questions to the teachers / instructors and where information could be easily accessed from both parties with all the forum options available.
The project was postponed due to school / "Hoved forl√∏b" starting, without being able to finish the project, whereas availability from the different members weren't optimal afterwards

The project is based in two main areas, Frontend and Backend, i was the one who maintained the backend part, setting up an API in C#, which would be able to handle all the requests the Frontend needed while storing all of it.
Whereas the Frontend was based in HTML, CSS and Javascript, and was maintained by two classmates.
As for the project planning, we utilized the SCRUM method as for planning and workflow
